# React Interface Component

## About

### In this app, I have created a web interface component that allows users to manage data.

### The interface allows users to add fields, delete fields, and define data types like string, number, boolean, and object. If the data type is an object, users can also add nested rows.

## Features

- Render the data management interface
- Edit field names
- Add more fields
- Delete fields
- Add nested fields to object types
- Provide a save button that logs the updated data
